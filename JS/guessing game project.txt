JS Introduction Final Project

How it works:
- The computer thinks of a number in the range (1-100)
- The player has to guess what it is
- The computer tells the player if answer is right or wrong
- When the game is over, the player is told how many times they guessed

What you need:
- A prompt everytime the page is loaded
- A form within that message displaying a message intended to get a number from 1-100
- A prompt which will only show when the incorrect number is answered
- A prompt which will only show when the correct number is answered

Steps:
- Create a function to create a prompt in the browser
- Within that function, write a decision to check the following:
	> If answer to the prompt is greater than or equal to 0 but less than 95
		**A prompt should appear stating that you should answer again.
	> If answer to the prompt is greater than or equal to 95 but less than 100.
		**A prompt should appear stating that you should answer again.
	> If answer to the prompt is greater than or equal to 95 but less than 97
		**Write to the browser: "Kaya FC is founded in the year 1996."
